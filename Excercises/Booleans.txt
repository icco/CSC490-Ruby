# Exercise Questions

# 1. What methods do TrueClass and FalseClass have, and why?

Both the TrueClass and the FalseClass have the following methods:  &, ^, to_s, |   

to_s turns the class into the representations we know and love (false and
true), while the other three methods exist so that class can do the basic
binary operations that one would do with a false value (and, or, XOR).

# 2. What array value is less than all other possible values?

[]

# 3. Does <=> work with boolean values?  With strings?

It works on strings, but not on boolean values.
