# 1. In a singleton method like a3.<=>, if call "super" in the
# redefinition code, what gets called?  Is it MyArray.<=> or Array.<=>?
# Answer this by instrumenting some sample code.
 
# 2. Change a1 so that it follows exactly opposite <=> rules than a normal
# array,  Do this with just 3 lines of code.

def a1.<=> (other)
   a1
end
 
# 3. Why does a4 > a3 in the P7 line turn out to be true??

P7 is true because we are calling a4.>, which in turn calls a4.<=>, which has not been changed, like a3.<=> has.
