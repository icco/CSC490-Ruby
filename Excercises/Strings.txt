# Exercises (consult Ruby docs for String and Array)
 
# 1. Write a single line that inserts the word "TEST" between the 2nd and 
# 3rd words (blank-delimited) of a string "str", assigning the result into str.
 
str = "Hi There"
str.split.insert(1, "TEST").join(' ')

# 2. Now write a single line to insert the sentence "Hi there" between the
# 1st and 2nd sentences of str, assuming sentences end with ".".

str = "Bonjour. My name is Joe."
str.split('. ').insert(1, "Hi There").join('. ')

# 3. Write a single expression that coverts a string of digits to its
# integer equivalent.  Do this for base 10 and base 8

str = "12345"
str.to_i 10 # Base 10
str.to_i 8 # Base 8

# 4. Assume we write s1 = s2 = "Hello".  Now, write a single statement
# without assigning into either variable, that changes both to "Goodbye"

s1 = s2 = "Hello"
s2.replace "Goodbye"
