# Exercises (consult Ruby docs for String and Array)
 
# 1. Write a single line that inserts the word "TEST" between the 2nd and 
# 3rd words (blank-delimited) of a string "str", assigning the result into str.
 

# 2. Now write a single line to insert the sentence "Hi there" between the
# 1st and 2nd sentences of str, assuming sentences end with ".".


# 3. Write a single expression that coverts a string of digits to its
# integer equivalent.  Do this for base 10 and base 8


# 4. Assume we write s1 = s2 = "Hello".  Now, write a single statement
# without assigning into either variable, that changes both to "Goodbye"
