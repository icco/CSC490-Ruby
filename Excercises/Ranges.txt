# Exercises
 
# 1. What happens if you range-index an array past its bounds?

It truncates the range to the array bounds and provides the up to the end of
the array.

# 2. What happens when you to_a a string range where start and end
# strings have different numbers of chars

you get an array full of strings that are slowly growing and increasing from
the starting point.

for example  
   ("a".."ab").to_a => ["a", ... , "w", "x", "y", "z", "aa", "ab"]
