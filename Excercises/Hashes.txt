# Exercises
 
# 1. Answer the "why start over" question from several lines above.

Because the keys don't have .eql? methods, we will never be able to overwrite
them, thus causing confusion in our tests.
 
# 2. Can two different types be keys in the same hash if they are not
# mutually comparable via <=>?  Why or why not?

yes, because Hash depends on the classes having .eql? methods, and .hash
methods. If they have <=>, Hash doesn't care.
 
# 3. Figure out what happened with the "Math" entry in depts.  This
# involves a detail regarding the return of default value.

a lookup in a hashtable returns the default value, if the key being looked up
has not been set to anything. Since the default value of this table is
"default" not {}, the value isn't set.
 
# 4. Write a single line that adds a new dept (might as well be
# "Math") to depts, with two members already in the dept.

depts["Math"] = { "Jones" => 1234 }
