# 1. Rewrite the P3 loop using bu.each, instead of for, and try it out.

bu.each do |i| 
   puts "P3: #{i}"
end

# 2. Write a single line that prints the number of even elements in an
# array of integers.
 
ints.map{|x| if x % 2 == 0; puts x end}

# 3. Write another single line that deletes all the odd elements from the
# array

ints = ints.delete_if{|x| x % 2 != 0}
