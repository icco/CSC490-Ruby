# Exercises
#
# 1. Setup up and then print out a 2x3x4 array of integers



# 2. Does == work to compare two 2x3x4 arrays?  How, if so?



# 3. What does this return, and why?  
# [[1,2], [3], [6]] <=> [[1, 2], [3, 1]]


# 4. Fill your array from 1 with 0's using the "fill" method
# from the docs.  Write this so that it will work correctly
# on any non-ragged 3-D array, of any size.  Use just a single
# statement (no loops), though you may have two fill calls in it
