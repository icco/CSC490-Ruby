## Major Ruby Concepts

 * Point of ruby: Don't be fast, be expressive and flexabile.
 * Ruby is interpretive, not compiled
 * Pure OO language. True smalltalk dirivitive.
   * Everything is an object. 3.upto(5)
 * Type is a moral principle, not a law
   * Ruby has no typing of it's reference variables
   * No need to downcasting
   * you can adjust a certain object's instance code on the fly
   * Closures..?
 * Made by one dude, Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto
   * Clint likes design by commitee. Ugh.
   * Evolves quickly (1.8 -> 1.9: Wheeeee)
 * Duck Typing: if it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, then it's a duck
   * str.capitilize() as long as you make it so str has that function, then
     it's cool.
 * Ruby syntax is for brevity:
   * No semi-colons, line breaks
   * parens can be left out for function calls
   * brackets can be left out
 * Auto-Declaration of Variables and Constants
 * Ruby has global variables
   * ARGV, STDIN, etc.
 * All member data is implicitly private. You can not make them public. 
 * Last bit of code in a block returns value
 * Operator overloading.
   * very few built in operators
 * Arrays
   * Like Java's ArrayList
 * Strings 
   * no char type in ruby > 1.9.
 * Ranges 
 * Hashes
   - Like php arrays I think
 * Inheritence
   * Kinda loose compared to java
 * No interfaces
   * Yay.
 * nil.
   * null
   * also equals false (sounds like php)
 * Modules
 * Assignments
 * RegEx!
   * I already love them, but ruby uses them a lot, huzzah!
 * Lots of other stuff, yay!
